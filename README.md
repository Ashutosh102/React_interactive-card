## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
-   Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
    -   Any input field is empty
    -   The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
-   View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

#### Expected behaviour

-   Update the details on the card as the user fills in the fields
-   Validate the form fields when the form is submitted
-   If there are no errors, display the completed state
-   Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state
